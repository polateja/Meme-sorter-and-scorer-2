# Meme-sorter-and-scorer-2
Read in a list of internet memes from a json file on the classpath (you choose the memes!). Create one method which takes the list of memes and sorts them by name. Create a second method which associates a "lulz" score (from 1-10) with each meme and writes the updated values to the same json file.
